# What if I told you...

There is an escape hatch from the Matrix. What if you could disconnect from society's imposed "norms"? Could you create your own rules? Could you live the life you are capable of?

There is a door inside that, once seen, can be opened. Transformative thinking can pick the lock.

With the right attitude, some luck and a little help from biohacking you can break trough to living as intended. Able to reprogram yourself armed with the right mindset. Here is the method worked for me and the people around. 

It involves some mental gymnastic in form of questions to contemplate. You can go at your own pace, it's up to you. This is how you start pulling the thread, anyway. 

I reached what goes by "englightment" in non-scientific circles and reprogrammed myself. This is how I got there and what I learned along the way. Here is my gift to the `IT Crowd` â€” Smart, Skeptical, Opinionated. Here is what worked.

# What worked?

Glad you asked.

Through research and experimentation. I've unveiled a pathway that, while reliable, requires dedication and inner
reflection. It involves adopting a particular mindset and recognizing the subtle indicators that signal its
effectiveness.

Before embarking on this transformative journey, adequate preparation is essential.
You need to realize what is going on with your life and why the things the way they are. 
Then some mental training is crucial to harness your newfound capabilities.
The instructions how to use them, is what I call the manual for your life.

> or touch. A prison for your mindâ€¦

# What do you know?

The prison was my own mind indeed. Have you ever feel you were destined for more? Does reality feels confining? 
Do you feel trapped in an endless cycle of the same Groundhog Day. 
Pick the lock and get out. Fix yourself. 
Get your life back. I'll help along the way.

# Can I even unplug?

Buddha said everybody has a chance.

# Can I do it by myself?

Do it. Start now. Read the book. See the videos. You need to know what to look for. I am posting everything online.
Everyone is free to do what they want. Learn yourself. Be the cause. Lead your life.

My mission is to empower you to live your best life.
