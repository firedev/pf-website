# Modern insightment for skeptics

**Insightment** â€” "insight" + "enlightenment". A profound understanding, a moment of clarity.

Much like a river's flow, life is in a constant state of change. Thinking forward means acknowledging this flow and navigating it skillfully. By being aware of impermanence, we can prepare ourselves for what lies ahead, adapting with wisdom and compassion. Instead of trying to control the river, or swimming upstream, we should only steer our own boat, making the journey more purposeful and harmonious.

We dwell on the past, worry about the future, diverting attention from the present.
The true magic of thinking forward is in the transformation you'll witness within yourself. It offers clarity and a deeper connection to the world around us.

You are your own best coach. Trust your instincts and believe in yourself.
You hold the power to transform your life. Unlock
the future filled with purpose and fulfillment.

# What seem to be the problem?

{:.prose}
- Don't like my job, my professional role, my income level
- Can't make decisions, make choices
- Don't have enough time for important things
- Devalue my past experience and achievements, repeat mistakes
- Have impostor syndrome
- Don't know what I want from life
- Afraid of changes

Sounds familiar?

# What if I told you...

There is an escape hatch from the Matrix. What if you could disconnect from society's imposed "norms"? Could you create your own rules? Could you live the life you are capable of?

There is a door inside that, once seen, can be opened. Transformative thinking can pick the lock.

With the right attitude, some luck and a little help from biohacking you can break trough to living as intended. Able to reprogram yourself armed with the right mindset. Here is the method worked for me and the people around.

It involves some mental gymnastic in form of questions to contemplate. You can go at your own pace, it's up to you. This is how you start pulling the thread, anyway.

I reached what goes by "enlightment" in non-scientific circles and reprogrammed myself. This is how I got there and what I learned along the way. Here is my gift to the `IT Crowd` â€” Smart, Skeptical, Opinionated. Here is what worked.

# What worked?

{:.bubble}
> People often do not have a chance to change their beliefs.
> We have to come up with the new therapy techniques.

Through research and experimentation. I've unveiled a pathway that, while reliable, requires dedication and inner
reflection. It involves adopting a particular mindset and recognizing the subtle indicators that signal its
effectiveness. Mental gymnastics reinforced with microdosing and psychedelic meditation might transform one's life on the spot.

Before embarking on this transformative journey, adequate preparation is essential.
You need to realize what is going on with your life and why the things the way they are.
Mind training is crucial to harness your newfound capabilities.
The instructions how to use them, is what I call the manual for your life.


# Can I really unplug?

Buddha said everybody has a chance. The prison is our own mind indeed. Does reality feels confining?
The Groundhog Day is one of my favorites. Do you ever feel there should be something more? Sounds strange even saying that. Anyway, you are not alone. There is a way out. But you literally have to break out of that shell inside of yourself. 

# Can I do it by myself?

I did most of the research by observing myself. Self-therapy works if you actually doing it. Start now. Read the book. See the videos. You need to know what to look for. I am posting everything online. 

Everyone is free to do what they want. So learn yourself, see where you're heading, so you can lead your life. Be the cause, not flowing with the flow.

Live now. Think forward. Break out.
