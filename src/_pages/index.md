# What if I told you...

There is an escape hatch from the Matrix. What if you could disconnect from society's imposed "norms"? Could you create your own rules? Could you live the life you are capable of?

The Matrix, like in the movie? The reality often seem to follow a certain path. Yeah, if we could only choose... But, hey, maybe we could.

There is a door that, once seen, can be opened. Transformative mindset with a bit of help from biohacking could pick the lock.

Here is how I reached the awakening and could reprogram myself. Here is what I learned along the way. Here is my gift to the `IT Crowd` — Smart, Skeptical, Opinionated. Here is what worked.

# What worked?

Glad you asked.

Through research and experimentation. I've unveiled a pathway that, while reliable, requires dedication and inner
reflection. It involves adopting a particular mindset and recognizing the subtle indicators that signal its
effectiveness.

Before embarking on this transformative journey, adequate preparation is essential.
You need to realize what is going on with your life and why the things the way they are. 
Then some mental training is crucial to harness your newfound capabilities.
The instructions how to use them, is what I call the manual for your life.

> — You are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage, born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste
> or touch. A prison for your mind…

# What do you know?

The prison was my own mind indeed. Have you ever feel you were destined for more? Does reality feels confining? 
Do you feel trapped in an endless cycle of the same Groundhog Day. 
Pick the lock and get out. Fix yourself. 
Get your life back. I'll help along the way.

# Can I even unplug?

Buddha said everybody has a chance.

# Can I do it by myself?

Do it. Start now. Read the book. See the videos. You need to know what to look for. I am posting everything online.
Everyone is free to do what they want. Learn yourself. Be the cause. Lead your life.

My mission is to empower you to live your best life.
