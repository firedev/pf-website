The beauty of nature multiplied by the depths of consciousness.

# 🫧 Highpoint

# 🏝️ Surin islands
Crystal-clear waters, vibrant coral reefs, and diverse marine life.  We stay in tents on a peaceful beach surrounded by an abundance of marine life. Two ocean trips a day with a break in between. Included:
— A unique long-tail boat for snorkeling and freediving excursions
— Comfortable beachside tents with air beds, mini fans, and lights
— All meals, snacks, and drinks
— Professional photos and video documentation

# 🧘‍♀️ The path
I welcome everybody to try the awakening path I went. Following meditation schedule with a certain state of mind one can get to awakening in about a week. But one week total is just not enough, so it's two.

# 🗓️ The Daily Schedule
We have three mediations and two activity blocks per day. For some adventures we'll use the whole day.

* 1 — Wake up
* 2 — Yoga
* 3 — Meditation
* 4 — Breakfast
* 5 — Activity 1: Yoga/Swimming/Adventuring
* 6 — Meditation
* 7 — Lunch break and rest
* 8 — Activity 2: Yoga/Swimming/Adventuring
* 9 – Meditation
* 10 — Integration/Workshop

# 🗓️ Weekly Schedule

We'll stay in Phuket and travel to the islands, where we'll spend a few days living in harmony with nature. Our days will be filled with snorkeling, island life, and plenty of time with the ocean. We'll stay together, and our daily routine will include yoga and meditation sessions.

Dates and schedules are estimates and subject to changes due to availability. It takes 2-3 days to learn minimal freediving and 3-4 days to experience it.

* Day 1 — Coming in and settling down
* Day 2 — The Surin Islands trip
* Day 3 — The Surin Islands trip
* Day 4 — The Surin Islands trip
* Day 5 — The Surin Islands trip
* Day 6 — Rest day
* Day 7 — Adventuring and Islands hopping

# ☯ Enlightenment

We'll practice together three times a day in a group setting. I'll be sharing all the expertise and "hacks" for achieving enlightenment. This will allow us to support and learn from each other, leading to breakthroughs and personal growth.


# ☀️ Environment

The weather in Thailand during this time is warm, with temperatures ranging from 26-28°C (79-82°F) throughout the day. The clear waters and breathtaking scenery will provide the perfect backdrop for our journey of self-discovery.

# 🥰️ Psychedelic Support

Psychedelics should be spaced at least a week apart, allowing to fully integrate the experience and insights before embarking on the next adventures.
