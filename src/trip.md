# Trip properly


With the help of psychedelics and transformative thinking one can break out trough the shackles that are holding back. Then the life begin to truly unfold. You start seeing more in everything. And you are given the ability to mend what's broken inside of you. Once you feel that feedback loop, the world starts changing in return.


## Not many tries left

Psychedelic means manifesting psyche — mind, soul. They act differently, but the result is the same. You start seeing your thoughts. They become tangible and you can work with them.

You can change the world in which you actually live. The world inside your head. 
But you can't do it too often because the magic wanes. We don't have that many chances to understand the world and ourselves. We need to make the most of it.

To maximize the effect, prepare diligently. **Do the homework.**

# To infinity and beyond

Proper trip often is life-changing. If you are prepared, know what to expect and what to pay attention to, it might transform you on the spot. A comprehensive approach ensures safe and transformative experience. I'm sharing this for those interested in exploring brain-hacking techniques.

It is important to minimize the risk of bad trip and then reinforce the insights while they are fresh. You might get frightened or start freaking out. The best way to proceed is to just accept the experience. Whatever happens is only you.

The other common issue is nausea, which usually goes away, after a while. Warming-up and body reaction testing helps.

It helps to have a seasoned journey companion to navigate the experience. Someone who guides the trip and helps to find valuable insights along the way.

The best way to avoid a bad trip is to have a good one. Prepare mentally and physically. And have a guide. From experience. If properly prepared. With proper set and setting and a trip-sitter at hand. When
everything goes as planned. Rebirth is practically guaranteed.

# SSS: Set, Settings, Sitter

## 1. Set.

First is the mindset. Approach this with eagerness to accept whatever comes your way. Remember, you're only seeing yourself. I try to tune in by asking myself some philosophical questions "Who am I?", "What do I want?", "What do I do?", "Where do I go?", I'll put up a list of for the self-guided sessions.

## 2. Setting.

Setting is time, space and the environment. I've found that early mornings in a remote, people-free location work best. For those who thrive at night, I suggest trying it alone outside during a full moon. So you don't bang into something in total darkness. Prepare the playlist, only top-shelf golden tracks, no words. DJ Mixes work wonders. See the examples in (Music)[/music]

## 3. ~~Sitter.~~ Trip advisor.

In a few trips you grow enough neurons to be always in control. I recommend the first breaktrough trip to be done with an experienced guide to help dive in and out. It's important to record the insights while you see the world as it is. If everything goes super smooth — the guide melts into the background so you could concentrate on yourself.

You should start using your new abilities, while the gates inside are still open. Grow new neural connections towards them. The forward thinking, seeing things as they are, and the life control. This is why a coaching session is a must to properly integrate it. The questions start flowing in immediately. I'll put a list too.

# Here's how I'd do it

Have a few days stay somewhere not in the city, away from people. Secluded places are best to mentally decompress with no distractions.

Have a cool-down and warm-up period. Start easing into the guided exploration of the neural constellations. Check bodily reactions to microdosing. And slowly turn the knob
to eleven.

For the main event see The Ideas below. It should be mind blowing. With no other people around.

Then unplug. Immerse in the experience of guided consciousness exploration.

> We've lost the sense of wonder and transformation that used to come from initiation rituals and miracles. These
> experiences were meant to be mysterious and beyond our understanding, in order to change who we are.

# Ideas

I preach tripping outside so you can blend in with nature. The best place is somewhere far reaching. The best times are sunrise, sunset and the full moon.

Music has serious healing effect. The magic is in the frequencies. I plan to get the best portable sound system. Go
to an inhabited island during the full moon and power it on. Hug the bass and feel the vibrations. Feel the magic.

Take off at the top of a mountain. The sky is magnificent on a starry night. The morning clouds that spread below. The
tip of the pyramid is the exit.

Walk through the forest or a park in the night. See that the trees are alive. It takes a few hours so the track should
be long enough to see the tunnel of reality.

# Why the Full Moon?

You can stay late outside and have some fun without risking your neck in pitch black darkness. With the healing magic of entheogenic spirit journey one can see the fabric of the universe under the moonlight. Depending on
the weather conditions of course.

It doesn't have to be the full moon. I found Sunday early mornings works best. You need a day of integration anyway. And for the maximum effect it should be done outside.

# How do I not forget?

Enlightenment is like a dream. You wake up and it's gone. You need to be asked question to remember. You need to be shown.
Check the section about common phenomena and what to pay attention to. It turns out that without knowing what to expect beforehand, people miss the most important insights.

Top it off with the new self integration sessions. You need to master your new abilities. And learn how not to forget
who you really are are. Read the parts about what to think. I write about this too.

# The planet is our home, and we do as we please.

Each person deserves to see what else life on Earth has to offer.

The sands of time are slipping away.

# So where's the book?

Working on it! Stay tuned...
