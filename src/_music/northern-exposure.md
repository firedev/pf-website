title: Northern Exposure
---

> It’s what every mix-CD wants to be: timeless.

One of the classics by British DJ duo Sasha & John Digweed. This album represents traveling the earth from the North to the South.

The first disk starts with David Attenborough and hits the nail on the head with the "Last Train to Lhasa".

The second one is starts to unfold around 10 minutes in with "The Gloom". And reaches its peak in the middle.

First double-disc set "Northern Exposure: North and South" is golden. It was followed by "Norther Exposure 2: East and West" which wasn't as good, but still worth the listen. Fortunately the duo still managed to pull it off in "Northern Exposure: Expeditions"
