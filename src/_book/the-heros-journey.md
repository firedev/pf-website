The Hero's Journey, also known as the monomyth, is a common narrative template found in various stories, myths, and adventures. It was first introduced by Joseph Campbell in his book "The Hero with a Thousand Faces".

The Hero's Journey follows a protagonist who embarks on an adventure, faces challenges, and ultimately returns home transformed or changed.

The journey can be divided into three main parts:

Departure: The hero's ordinary life is disrupted by a call to adventure. They may initially refuse the call but eventually accept it, crossing the threshold into a new world or realm. Here, they encounter mentors, allies, and enemies who shape their journey

Initiation: The hero faces various trials, tests, and ordeals, often experiencing a symbolic death and rebirth. They may receive a reward, gain knowledge, or acquire a special power. This stage is about the hero's transformation and growth

Return: The hero returns to their ordinary world, bringing back the elixir, a reward or treasure that will benefit others. They may face a final challenge or crisis before fully integrating their newfound knowledge and experiences into their life
