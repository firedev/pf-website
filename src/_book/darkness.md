But we need darkness to tell light apart. If we didn’t have eyes we still had some representation of the world in our heads and probably didn’t even complain.

Fortunately, we see. And like darkness helps us see the light. Feel bad allows us to see what is good. But this is also why you can’t be happy all the time. After a while it starts to feel like nothing. Even the white color begins to fade.

And the cycle continues.
