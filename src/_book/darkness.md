But we need darkness to tell light apart. Without darkness there would be no light. If we didn’t have eyes we still would had some representation of the world in our heads and didn’t even complain.

Fortunately, we see. And like darkness helps us see the light. Feeling bad allows us to feel what is good. Otherwise everything would be just meh. But this is also why you can’t be happy all the time. After a while the happiness dissipates and everything starts to feel like nothing. Even the white color begins to fade to gray if you stare at it long enough.

And the cycle continues.
