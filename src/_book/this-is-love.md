We inherit not just the nervous tissue. 
From the simplest bacterium to the most complex human being, there exists a fundamental emotion that binds all living things together â€” The Love for Life.

It is the silent force that drives every living entity to survive, grow, and thrive. It's universal and needs no explanation. It's the reason even a single-celled organism seeks nourishment, and it's what compels a plant to reach for the sunlight. The love for life is often expressed as a deep-seated instinct to protect oneself, to seek out nourishment, and to form connections with others.

Interestingly, it's often the little ones, both human and animal, who seem to feel and revel in this love for life most profoundly. It's the reactor that powers our lives. It's a pity that somewhere along the journey, that vibrant inner light begins to dim. This is why I am writing these words. It's always easier to prevent.

This primal emotion is the foundation upon which all other feelings and behaviors are built. It's the source of our vitality, our resilience, and our innate drive to persevere through challenges. Even in the face of adversity, this love for life fuels our determination to overcome obstacles and find meaning in our existence.

In essence, it's the heartbeat of life itself, echoing through every living being, reminding us of the preciousness and value inherent in every moment of our existence. Without that innate love for life, our journey on Earth would lose its meaning, what's the point of suffering all the time. It's this profound affection for existence that keeps us tethered to this world.
