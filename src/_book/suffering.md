The first Noble Truth of Buddhism: "Suffering exists". When talking about suffering, Buddha didn't mean some "No Pain No Gain" bumper sticker. He had a precise list of so-called defilements of the mind. They all start from Greed, Hate and Delusion. And I would add that Fear is the root of them all.

Defilements are contagious, they penetrate others and play themselves. Thoughts think themselves. Each person can list what they dislike, what annoys them and what they can not stand. Anyone can tell what's not right in their life, how things could be or should be. And with their own variations, you can infect others. Guess what, there's no one else. This is water. You only release poison into your aquarium.
 
The catch is that none of the suffering exists. Discomfort is created personally in the head. It's all imaginary. Custom-tailored to get exactly you. You can simply ignore any of that. That's the essence of enlightenment. You start seeing through the illusion. A suitcase without a handle can be left behind; it's no longer needed. It doesn't exist. It never existed.

Keep only good things in life. Only what you want. Everything else just doesn't happen. Yes, something exists on the other side of the screen. Not on this side. Not on mine.

No excess. Only what's loved. Loved people. Loved activities. Loved life. No thing else is required. Suffering not required.
