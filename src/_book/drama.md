The Karpman's Drama Triangle is a trap that once you want to steer clear of. Itâ€™s a psychological model that maps out dysfunctional interactions between individuals. It identifies three main roles: the Victim, the Persecutor, and the Rescuer. The drama triangle is infamous for its knack to draw more and more people into its dynamics.

- **Victim:** This is the person who feels oppressed, helpless, or in some kind of distress. They often seek sympathy and support from others, thus luring people in.

- **Persecutor:** This role is taken on by someone who criticizes, blames, or attacks the Victim. They may appear aggressive or domineering.

- **Rescuer:** The Rescuer attempts to help or protect the Victim from the Persecutor. Or thinks that is helping. They often do so with the intention of feeling needed or superior.


This dynamic tends to cycle, with individuals switching roles. A Victim might eventually become a Persecutor or Rescuer when situation changes.

Recognizing this pattern is crucial because it leads to unhealthy and unproductive relationships. Aim for healthier dynamics where people communicate openly, take responsibility for their actions, and seek mutual understanding. As usual telling the truth helps.

Recognize and avoid the Drama Triangle at all costs. Be mindful of these roles and consciously work towards constructive interactions. Foster relationships based on respect, empathy, and mutual support, rather than falling into patterns of victimization, blame, and rescue.

You can only help those who do something. But first of all, help yourself. Two drowns are not better than one.
