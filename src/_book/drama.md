The Karpman's Drama Triangle is like a trap you want to steer clear of. is a psychological model that maps out dysfunctional interactions between individuals. It identifies three main roles: the Victim, the Persecutor, and the Rescuer. It's infamous for its knack to draw more and more people into its dynamics.

- **Victim:** This is the person who feels oppressed, helpless, or in some kind of distress. They often seek sympathy and support from others.

- **Persecutor:** This role is taken on by someone who criticizes, blames, or attacks the Victim. They may appear aggressive or domineering.

- **Rescuer:** The Rescuer attempts to help or protect the Victim from the Persecutor. They often do so with the intention of feeling needed or superior.


This dynamic tends to cycle, with individuals switching roles. A Victim might eventually become a Persecutor or Rescuer in a different situation.


Recognizing this pattern is crucial because it can lead to unhealthy and unproductive relationships. Aim for healthier dynamics where people communicate openly, take responsibility for their actions, and seek mutual understanding. As usual telling the truth helps.

Avoiding the Drama Triangle at all costs. Be mindful of these roles and consciously work towards constructive interactions. Fostering relationships based on respect, empathy, and mutual support rather than falling into patterns of victimization, blame, and rescue.
