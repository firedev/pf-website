Jordan Peterson says that life is suffering, while Buddha called suffering a broad range of unsatisfactory experiences. But we can agree it's not a welcomed addition to life. How
come many people say everything is file just life is so hard? What exactly is hard in life? To reach your goals? Or to never reach them? 

This is not a book about how to be happy. It's about how to be free. Happiness is a byproduct of freedom. Freedom is a byproduct of self-awareness. Self-awareness is a result of a forward thinking. Which is a habit that thinking forward forms.

By thinking forward I mean not holding yourself back with every phrase. Not adding the brake liquid. No "but", "however", and other anchors pulling back. To reach this state you have to be aware of your thoughts and emotions.  You have to be aware of what's going on in your head.

Problem is the head is attached to your body and whatever you think you want â€” you're not in control.

There are many jokes about not seeing what's right in front of you. It's funny because it's true. We are so busy with our thoughts and at the same time we're so perplexed by the outside, we stop seeing what's really happening both around and inside us.

If you feel that life is not going the way you wanted. I propose to simply fix that. It works for those willing to change. In Buddhism, teachers and guides can provide guidance and teachings, the actual progress on the path is ultimately the responsibility of the individual. True transformation comes from one's own actions and efforts. You have to walk the last mile yourself.
