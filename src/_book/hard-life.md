Jordan Peterson plainly asserts that life is suffering. We could debate the meaning of this word. Buddha, for instance, referred to a wide spectrum of unsatisfactory experiences as suffering. Regardless of the terminology, it's widely accepted that suffering isn't a welcome part of our lives. So, why do we seem to excel at it? Can't we simply put an end to it?

This is not a book about how to attain happiness. It's a guide on how to attain freedom. Happiness, in its essence, has a negative nature. It's what remains when you subtract the undesirable parts. It's a byproduct of freedom from the vicious cycle. And this freedom, in turn, is a byproduct of self-awareness and breaking free.

The concept of thinking forward that I advocate for means liberating yourself from your own limitations. Stop adding the brake fluid. Eliminate the "buts" and "howevers," those anchors that drag you back. To reach this mental state, one must keenly observe their thoughts and emotions. You have to be aware of what's going on in your head, keeping a vigilant eye on their mental landscape.

lies in the fact that our minds are firmly tethered to our bodies, and whatever we believe we desire, we do not have complete control over.

There are countless jokes about not seeing what's right in front of us. They are funny because it is so true. We become so entangled in our thoughts and simultaneously perplexed by external circumstances, that we overlook what's really happening within and around us.

If you feel that life is not going the way you wanted.  I propose starting with mending the vessel, which is your mind. Think on what you find interesting, it works for those willing to change. In Buddhism, teachers can only provide guidance, the actual progress on the path is ultimately the responsibility of the individual. True transformation comes from one's own actions and efforts. You have to walk the last mile yourself.
