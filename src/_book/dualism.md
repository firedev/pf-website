The yin-yang symbol is a fundamental concept in Chinese philosophy, representing the interplay of opposites. It symbolizes the concept of dualism, which describes opposite but interconnected forces.

Dichotomy of the world. These are not two separate parts. They are like the sides of the coin. Like day and night canâ€™t be separate because they are part of the cycle.

Yin and yang are complementary forces. They are not static or absolute. They exist in a dynamic equilibrium. In a constant state of flux and transformation. The concept signifies seemingly opposing forces or elements are interconnected and interdependent.

* **Yin** is associated with as darkness, chaos and femininity. It represents the hidden, the intuitive, and the nurturing aspects of nature and existence.

* **Yang** symbolises light, order, and masculinity. It symbolizes the visible, the rational, and the dynamic aspects of nature and existence.

The small circle within each half represents the potential for the emergence of one aspect within the other, suggesting that yin and yang are not completely separate but contain traces of each other. This reflects the idea that nothing is entirely yin or yang, but rather a blend of both.

And the image is not static.
