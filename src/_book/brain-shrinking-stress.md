# Stress shrinks your brain

No problem, everybody is anxious these days, right? In fact there is an issue, the chronic stress literally shrinks your brain.

When you're stressed, your body releases cortisol, often called the 'stress hormone.' In small doses, it does some important jobs. It helps regulate blood pressure, keeps blood sugar steady, and reduces inflammation. Our bodies have a natural response to stress, and cortisol steps in as the main player. Think of it as the body's way of gearing up to face a challenge.

But here's the catch. When stress becomes a constant, cortisol levels stay high for longer periods. This prolonged exposure starts reshaping our brain, and not in a good way. Specifically, it leads to a shrinkage of certain brain areas. Two regions that take a hit are the hippocampus, which is like our brain's librarian, overseeing memory and learning, and the prefrontal cortex, the wise conductor of our thoughts, emotions, and actions. You can think of them as essential command centers. 

Chronic stress doesn't just play havoc with our emotions. It makes learning, remembering, and decision-making tougher. It's a bit like a muscle that weakens without regular exercise. In this case, it's the structural integrity of our brain that's at stake. 

Basically you devolve back into a monkey. That's why easing the existential fear is the most effective way of getting rid of stress. It isn't just a luxury â€” it's a necessity for our well-being and brainpower.
