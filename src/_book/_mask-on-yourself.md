First things first. There is only you in the universe of your mind. From which you see the world through your own looking glass. Aptly named The Tunnel of Reality by Thimothy Leary when he was still in Harward.

Mask on Yourself is a beacon of wisdom. Before extending help to others, first ensure our own well-being. Fix your sh*t first. This doesn't have anything to do with selfishness. Why?

# You are your responsibility

Because you are the person who needs your help the most. You must be your own friend. Your problems are not your fault. Besides they don't really exist. You are not your fault. So take responsibility for your actions and for your life. Help yourself.

# Order > Happiness

Peterson helped to realize it. Since then I am trying to to think about anything. Which helped me to notice that nothing is actually going on.

# Be the adult you needed as a child

Right now when you old enough and know everything about you, fix it.

# Set your house in perfect order

Before you criticize the world. Perfect.

# Not too much, just one foot in order

Which is exactly what zen is about. One foot in order, one foot in chaos. The balance.s

# No expectations

And again as in buddhism. No expectations. No disappointments. No suffering.

# Good mood

And the most important. Consistent good mood. Many people hide their identity, tolerate restrictions, and remain in bad relationships because they're afraid of being lonely. But I wonder what they mean by lonely. Aren't they very lonely when they deal with people who don't understand and appreciate them?
