Confucius alledgedly said "We have two lives, and the second begins when we realize we have only one".

I saw it somewhere on internet and it hit me. Wait, what am I doing with my life? And that is how the bounceback started.

My second life. The only one there was. The only one there is. Forever. And forever isn't that long either, because now I want every drop of it.
