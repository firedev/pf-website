The prevailing belief that one should constantly think over one global issue or another. But it is a lie. It's perfectly normal to consistently feel good. This is not an achievment, it is normal. It is _the norm_.

You can't always feel happy, but you can be content. I would argue that in the abscence of worry and fear one could start feeling the joy of being alive. The inner joy. True peace and tranquility arising from within, independent of circumstances, possessions, or other factors. It is something that must be cultivated and discovered within oneself, in one's own mind and heart.

The consistent good mood is an indicator. It's the blank piece of paper, the still surface of the mind's reservoir. It serves as the backdrop against which dark spots or waves immediately visible. You need to become accustomed to consistently being in a good mood. And then it's automatic.

You wake up and something feels wrong, you'll notice it right away. However, if you fail to recognize the darkness and don't take active steps to address it, it will engulf everything.
