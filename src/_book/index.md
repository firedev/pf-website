"Know thyself" is a timeless philosophical principle etched onto the ancient Greek Temple of Apollo in Delphi. These words had no meaning until I realized I don't know that. Who am I? What is life? Am I living right? Am I good? Am I brave? Will I betray? 

I tried to find the source of myself, the roots, so to speak. And it turned out to dig it out I had to somehow fix the objective viewpoint.

So to apply the scientific method of self-discovery I had to assess my own behaviour in different situation. But staying objective towards oneself is really hard, you are inside. To make things easier I came up with the first rule of life.

## Rule 1: Do not lie, especially to yourself.

You are the easiest people to fool. The Do Not Lie mantra has revealed itself as the bedrock of existence. It acts as an antidote to a psychic phenomenon Buddha identified as the 'clinging'. We habitually dissect and classify every experience we undergo. Our minds grasp onto viewpoints, beliefs, and opinions. We adhere to customary rituals to the extent of fixation. Our bodies seek sensory gratification, craving stimuli for all five senses. In addition, there's an odd lens that distorts our perception of ourselves. The mind sticks to everything, wants more, and whispers in our ear. Strangely it became obvious that I was wanting and doing things I regretted later.

To combat this I stopped lying completely. It felt a little strange at first, but in a good way. I stopped doing things I couldn't later tell about. This already improved my life quite a bit. I stopped being involved in shady stories. I stopped keeping in mind what I said when. I stopped being afraid of being caught. I stopped being afraid of being judged. I stopped being afraid of being myself. I stopped being afraid of being.

After such success I had to come up with the second rule to keep the professional life in order:

## Rule 2: Don't deal with jerks. 

If someone sets you up on small stuff, they will do it when shit hits the fan. You can't totally avoid them. Sometimes they can be your co-workers and professionals. Just don't get involved with them. And, because it is crucial to find the right people, someone you can trust, the flipside rule: 



## Rule 3: Don't be a jerk.

Don't lie. Don't do stupid things. And the right people will see you. Those, who's intentions are good, won't be misunderstood. The rest will eventually fall off the wagon. 

Once I came up with the rules, agreed with them, they became an essential part of the "me" framework. This is how I started to change myself. This triad had served well since.

I've since read numerous books on Psychology, Neurology, and Brain Functioning, digging for insights to fix and enrich life. It held more potential than I could imagine with my little brain. Over the next few years, I moved in self-discovery more than I had in my entire life before. I fixed myself.

The next turning point was the discovery of microdosing. Then the pace of events began to accelerate. A couple of years combined with contemplation and the exploration of Buddhism surpassed everything before. I recognized that Buddhism Psychology dealt with the same experiences and understanding of life that I had. It showed me that I am on the right path. And I've realized I can't do anything for myself anymore. So I started improving lives around me.

You need to start pulling the thread of pull yourself out. Here is the guide on how to understand how to live your own life. I wish somebody had explained it to me. This is something they forgot to teach in the school and at home nobody knew what they are doing. I couldn't find a book that encapsulated the essentials either. So, this is that book. This is what I wanted to hear when I was young. This is what I tell my kids. As it turns out, I had been holding it wrong. Life that is.

To start pulling it out you need to be asked the right questions. This is akin to Buddist Koans I never understood. It's a kind of philosophical joke, usually a paradox, like "If the tree is falling and there is no one will it make a sound?". This sounded ridiculous until I realized that the answer to this is not "Of course, we can record the sound", it's "Right, to perceive the sound vibration as a sound of a falling tree someone must hear it". I wrote down the thoughts that will help. 

Buddha warned that you can't save everyone, let's help those who can be helped. This is what led me to a healthier, happier, and more mindful life. This is what worked.

Let's dive into understanding how we function and what we can about it. Join me on this journey of self-exploration. To uncover the source of sustainable joy in our lives.

Every journey starts with a single step. Let's try a simple question:

Who are you?
