Which part of your being defines "you"? Is it solely your physical form? 

If you were to lose an arm, would you be any less "you"? 

Or is it perhaps the awe-inspiring wonder that is your brain, a marvel in its own right?

When one passes away the physical structure of the brain remains unaltered, holding the memories and knowledge amassed over a lifetime. 
Yet we can't say by brain scans did the person knew English? Could they ride a bicycle? 

Consciousness, that unique essence we often refer to as "I" fades into the background.
As if the vibrant orchestra of the mind falls silent.

The essence of life, your true self, doesn't reside within the intricate network of neurons or the matter of the brain itself. 
It thrives in the intangible spaces between those neurons, in the ethereal connections that define the essence of your existence. 
It is in this ineffable realm that your consciousness truly resides, giving life its rich tapestry of thoughts, emotions, and experiences.

It is the profound electrochemical reaction, an ethereal flame that courses within. 
That is the true essence of your being.

It is this internal spark that illuminates your existence.

# How come we know very little about ourselves?

Our body is formed before we appear. It lives and functions before a consciousness emerges within it. 
Before we come into being. We step into a fully operational vehicle. 

How do you become aware of something that has existed since before you were born? 
Strangely, we often overlook our very own body, despite it being our constant companion. A solitary cell that we inhabit since the very beginning.

# The sixth sense

We know the basic five senses: **Vision**, **Taste**, **Touch**, **Hear**, and **Smell**. 
In Buddhism, they consider the sixth sense â€“ **The Mind** or consciousness itself. 
The mind is regarded as the sixth sense because it is the primary means through which we experience and interact with the world.

Buddhist teachings emphasize the importance of understanding and mastering the mind to develop greater insight, clarity, and wisdom.

# But wait, what are those?

Turns out we sense a lot more. **Balance**, **Temperature**, **Pain**, **Position**. The body is constantly sending us signals. Where are our limbs? Are we moving? Are we falling? Is it cold? Where is up?

**Stretch**, **Pressure**, **Vasolidation**, **Acceleration**... The list goes on. Some researches agree on 21 senses, some go up to 53. One this is certain, though. We are always connected to this endless stream of body signals. This has started before we were born, before we become aware of ourselves, we don't even notice it anymore.

Our sense of self is closely tied to our physical body. We are blind wisemen in out bodies trying to comprehend an elephant in a dark room. 
Is it like a rope, a wall, or a tree? We touch the world around us with all our senses.

But, okay, it is what it is, we feel the world around us, one way or another. Can we even trust our perception?
