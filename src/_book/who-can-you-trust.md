Now that we at least partially aware of the whole bio machinery of our perceptions. Let's put them to the test to see how
reliable those senses are.


# Triangle

Let's start with a simple example. Do you see the triangle? You can probably see it with your eyes closed as well.

You can click numbers `1` to `4` so the picture stays in one place. Click `1` to start.

<a id="1">

[**1**](#1) [2](#2) [3](#3) [4](#4)

Now do you still see it? Click `2`.

<a id="2">

[1](#1) [**2**](#2) [3](#3) [4](#4)

What about the smaller circle? No problem, right? Click `3`.

<a id="3">

[1](#1) [2](#2) [**3**](#3) [4](#4)

Now let's break the illusion. Click `4`

<a id="4">

\*Poof\* magic dispelled. We don't even like lines as much as angles. As soon as they are misaligned the illusion vanishes.

But the main point here — there was no triangle at all. The mind is just playing tricks on us.

The interesting part here is that we can be in either one or another state of mind.

# Not Reading

What if I tell you that you don’t even read?

Wait, what? Yep. You just scan the lines and the brain gives you the whole words. 
Important here is that you can feel it's easier to read if you aren't even trying. 
Because something in your body is doing that for you. We'll come to that later. 

# Famous People

And here is my personal favorite. This is what happens when someone comes to talk to you, 
while you are staring at your phone screen.
